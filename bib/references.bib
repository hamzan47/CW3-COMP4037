  abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

    abstract = {Employee scheduling is a complex optimization problem that requires balancing organizational needs with employee preferences and constraints. This study proposes a fast-flexible strategy for employee scheduling, incorporating adjustable work hours within a specified range to address overstaffing and understaffing issues. The approach employs a pairwise-allocated strategy and a proficiency average matrix to enhance scheduling efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance in terms of computational speed and solution quality, making the method suitable for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. The strategy is particularly relevant for dynamic industries like hospitality, where part-time worker scheduling demands flexibility and responsiveness.},
