    abstract = {Employee scheduling is a complex optimization problem that requires balancing organizational needs with employee preferences and constraints. This study proposes a fast-flexible strategy for employee scheduling, incorporating adjustable work hours within a specified range to address overstaffing and understaffing issues. The approach employs a pairwise-allocated strategy and a proficiency average matrix to enhance scheduling efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance in terms of computational speed and solution quality, making the method suitable for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. The strategy is particularly relevant for dynamic industries like hospitality, where part-time worker scheduling demands flexibility and responsiveness.},
