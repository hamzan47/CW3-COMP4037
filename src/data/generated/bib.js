        "abstract": "Employee scheduling is a complex optimization problem that requires balancing organizational needs with employee preferences and constraints. This study proposes a fast-flexible strategy for employee scheduling, incorporating adjustable work hours within a specified range to address overstaffing and understaffing issues. The approach employs a pairwise-allocated strategy and a proficiency average matrix to enhance scheduling efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance in terms of computational speed and solution quality, making the method suitable for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. The strategy is particularly relevant for dynamic industries like hospitality, where part-time worker scheduling demands flexibility and responsiveness.",

        "abstract": "Scheduling part-time workers in service industries requires balancing employee preferences with operational demands. This study proposes an integer programming model to schedule part-time personnel, maximizing employee satisfaction by incorporating availability, shift preferences, and seniority. Tested on retail instances, the model uses branch-and-cut methods to achieve efficient solutions. Its focus on part-time scheduling makes it highly relevant for hospitality applications, though adaptation for mobile devices requires lightweight implementations.",
